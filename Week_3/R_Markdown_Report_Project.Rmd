```

# Problem 1 

Create a vector of five numbers of your choice between 0 and 10, 
save that vector to an object, and use the sum() function to 
calculate the sum of the numbers.

```{r,problem1}
vector1 <- c(1,3,5,7,9)
sum_vector1 = sum(vector1)
sum_vector1
```

# Problem 2

Create a data frame that includes two columns. One column must 
have the numbers 1 through 5, and the other column must have the 
numbers 6 through 10. The first column must be named "alpha" and 
the second column must be named "beta". Name the object "my_dat". 
Display the data.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r,problem2}
alpha<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
beta<-c(6,7,8,9,10)
my_dat<-data.frame(alpha,beta)
my_dat
```

# Problem 3 

Using the data frame created in Problem 2, use the summary() 
command a create a five-number summary for the column named
"beta".

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r,problem3}
beta_summary<-summary(beta,5)
beta_summary
```

# Problem 4

There is code for importing the example survey data that will 
run automatically in the setup chunk for this report (Line 13). 
Using that data, make a boxplot of the Family Income column using
the Base R function (not a figure drawn using qplot). Include 
your name in the title for the plot. Your name should be in the 
title. Relabel that x-axis as "Family Income".

Hint: consult the codebook to identify the correct column name 
for the family income question.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r,problem4}
FI<-(dat$faminc_new)
boxplot(FI,main="Tom James",xlab="Family Income")
```

# Problem 5

Using the survey data, filter to subset the survey data so you 
only have male survey respondents who live in the northwest or 
midwest of the United States, are married, and identify as being 
interested in the news most of the time. 

Use the str() function to provide information about the resulting
dataset.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem5,include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
filtered_data <- dat %>% filter(
  .data[["gender"]] == 1, # Male
  .data[["marstat"]] == 1, # Married
  .data[["newsint"]] == 1, # Interested in the news most of the time
  .data[["region"]] < 3 # Live in the Northwest or Midwest
)
filtered_data_str<-str(filtered_data)
filtered_data_str
```

# Problem 6

Filter the data the same as in Problem 5. Use a R function to 
create a frequency table for the responses for the question 
asking whether these survey respondents are invested in the 
stock market. 

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem6,include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
table1<-table(filtered_data$investor)
table1
``` 

# Problem 7

Going back to using all rows in the dataset, create a new column 
in the data using mutate that is equal to either 0, 1, or 2, to 
reflect whether the respondent supports increasing the standard 
deduction from 12,000 to 25,000, supports cutting the corporate 
income tax rate from 39 to 21 percent, or both. Name the column 
"tax_scale". Hint: you'll need to use recode() as well.
 
Display the first twenty elements of the new column you create.

Put your code and solution here:

```{r problem7,include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# Helper function:
hlpr <- function(col) { return(col %>% recode(`2` = 0L)) }
# Create the tax_scale column:
dat <- dat %>% mutate(tax_scale = hlpr(dat$CC18_325a) + hlpr(dat$CC18_325d))
# Display the first 20 elements of tax_scale:
dat$tax_scale[1:20]
```

# Problem 8

Use a frequency table command to show how many 0s, 1s, and 2s are 
in the column you created in Problem 7.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem8,include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
freqtable1<-table(dat$tax_scale)
freqtable1
```

# Problem 9

Again using all rows in the original dataset, use summarise and
group_by to calculate the average (mean) job of approval for 
President Trump in each of the four regions listed in the 
"region" column.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem9}
# Calculate the average job approval for President Trump in each region:
dat %>%
    group_by(region) %>%
    summarise(Trump_Approve_Mean = round(mean(CC18_308a), digits = 2))
```

# Problem 10

Again start with all rows in the original dataset, use summarise()
to create a summary table for survey respondents who  are not 
investors and who have an annual family income of between 
$40,000 and $119,999 per year. The table should have the mean, 
median and standard deviations for the importance of religion 
column.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem10}
dat %>%
    # Filter the survey data:
    filter(
        .data[["faminc_new"]] > 4, # Income greater than or equal to $40,000
        .data[["faminc_new"]] < 11, # Income less than $120,000
        .data[["investor"]] == 2 # Non-investors
    ) %>%
    # Create the summary table:
    summarise(
        "Mean Religion Imp." = mean(pew_religimp),
        "Median Religion Imp." = median(pew_religimp),
        "Standard Dev. Religion Imp." = sd(pew_religimp)
    )
```

# Problem 11

Use kable() and the the summarise() function to create a table 
with one row and three columns that provides the mean, median, 
and standard deviation for the column named faminc_new in the 
survey data.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem11}
# Create the summary table:
dat %>%
    summarise(
        Mean = mean(faminc_new),
        Median = median(faminc_new),
        "Std. Dev." = sd(faminc_new)
    ) %>%
    kable()
```

# Problem 12

With the survey data, use qplot() to make a histogram of the 
column named pid7. Change the x-axis label to "Seven Point Party 
ID" and the y-axis label to "Count".

Note: you can ignore the "stat_bin()" message that R generates 
when you draw this. The setup for the code chunk will suppress 
the message.

Put your code and solution here:
  
```{r problem12,message=FALSE}
# Make a histogram of the pid7 column:
qplot(
    dat$pid7,
    geom = "histogram",
    xlab = "Seven-Point Party ID", # x-axis label
    ylab = "Count" # y-axis label
)
```
